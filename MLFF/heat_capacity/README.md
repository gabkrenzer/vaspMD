# Heat Capacity Calculations From Molecular Dynamics

The heat capacity can be extracted from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations run at different temperatures using two different methods:
1. Computing the numerical derivative of energy, $E$, with respect to temperature, $T$: $C=\frac{dE}{dT}$.
2. Using the equation: $C_v=\frac{(<E^2>-<E>^2)}{k_BT^2}$.
Both methods should give the same result. hey
